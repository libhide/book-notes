## Get Programming with Haskell

By Will Kurt

### Unit 2 - Introducing types

- Types determine the kinds of computation that can be done on certain data.
- In any programming language, you need to know the types you're working with so you can either throw an error when types donâ€™t match or do some sort of automatic conversion using type transformation rules.
- Dynamically typed languages (Python, JS etc.): Flexible type systems, checked at runtime. This leads to errors at runtime which can be dangerous in production if you ship something that will run (and break) 6 months in the future. To address this issue, we write unit tests for everything.
- Statically typed languages (Java, C# etc.): If type errors occur, compilation won't occur. This prevents bugs from creeping into running programs. The downside here is that programmers need to explictly declare types for everything.
- Haskell is statically typed but uses heavy type inference which allows programmers to leave out types in declarations.

Bonus:

- Dynamically typed languages get bad rep by people who don't understand why they came into existence. They exist to solve a particular problem.
- Back in the day when memory was limited, the `loading` and `linking` processes of the compile process used to take a really long time to complete. This meant that testing software took time, deploying took even longer.
- This was one of the main reasons why dynamically typed languages came into existence. Moving process like type-checking to runtime meant that build times and deploy times became much faster.
- The point is that there are trade-offs to each decision. Dynamically typed languages get a bad rep for no clear reason these days. People just don't know what problem these languages are meant to solve.

#### Lesson 11: Type basics

- Haskell's type system is what distinguishes it from other programming languages. It is very robust.
- Types in Haskell all start with uppercase letters to distinguish them from functions in Haskell. eg. `Int`
- Some types in Haskell are bounded ie. they can hold values only in a particular range. For example, `Int` is bounded while its unbounded counterpart `Integer` isn't.
- A list of characters `[Char]` is the same as a `String`. Haskell allows us to use `String` as a type synonym for `[Char]`.
- `half n = n/2` is incorrect code because we cannot divide a whole number into two parts. We instead have to do some type conversion.
- Haskell does not perform implicit type conversion like Python or Ruby. In Python or Ruby, 5/2 is 2 which is not the case in Haskell.
- In Haskell, literal numbers are polymorphic ie. their type is determined by where they're being used at compile time. So, in Haskell 5/2 is 2.5 by default.
- If you can't figure out the types in your code then Haskell's type inference will not be able to either.
- In functions with multiple arguments, the last type is always the return type.

```haskell

makeAddress :: Int -> String -> String -> (Int, String, String)
makeAddress number street town = (number, street, town)

-- is the same as

makeAddressLambda = (\number ->
                     (\street ->
                      (\town -> (number, street, town)))

```

- Haskell has type variables to allow for wildcard types. In `simple :: a -> a`, `a` can become the type the of the variable that is passed to `simple`. In this way, `simple :: a -> a` can become either `simple :: Int -> Int` or `simple :: Char -> Char` using only one base definition.

#### Lesson 12: Creating your own types

- Creating types in Haskell is as important as creating classes in OOP.
- Types can be assigned synonyms in Haskell. This lets us do incredibly cool things like converting `areaOfCircle :: Double -> Double` to `areaOfCircle :: Diameter -> Area` where `Diameter` and `Area` are type synonyms.
- New types in Haskell can be created using the `data` keyword. The synax for this is:

```haskell

-- Syntax
data TYPE_CONSTRUCTOR = DATA_CONSTRUCTOR <ARG1> <ARG2> ...

-- Examples:

data Sex = Male | Female
-- here the entire expression is the DATA_CONSTRUCTOR and there are no args

type FirstName = String
type LastName = String
data Name = Name FirstName LastName
-- here Name is the DATA_CONSTRUCTOR and there are two args: FirstName and LastName

```
