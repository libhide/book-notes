17. Change your viewpoint to solve the problem.

### Chapter 1: Introduction

- The essence of _pragmatism_ is to do what works — for you.
- Everything is interconnected: the physical world, social systems, your innermost thoughts, the unrelenting logic of the computer—everything forms one immense, interconnected system of reality. Nothing exists in isolation; everything is part of the system and part of a larger context.
- Small things having unexpectedly large effects is the hallmark of nonlinear systems.
- Systems thinking is a way to look at the world in which one tries to envision an object as a connection point of several systems, rather than as a discrete object unto itself. _Everything is interconnected_.

### Chapter 2: Journey from Novice to Expert

#### Introduction

- `Event theories` are a category of theories that can be measured; these types of theories can be verified and proven. You can judge the accuracy of an event theory.
- `Construct theories` are another category of theories that are intangible abstractions; you cannot prove them.  Instead, construct theories are evaluated in terms of their usefulness.
- Example of a construct theory: the concept of _Mind_. Mind is an abstraction; there’s really no such thing.  It’s just an idea, a concept.
- Dreyfus's model of skill acquisition is a construct theory.
- There’s more to skill levels than just being better, smarter, or faster. The Dreyfus model describes how and why our abilities, attitudes, capabilities, and perspectives change with skill level.

#### Novices vs Experts

- The novices need clear, context-free rules by which they can operate.
- The experts on the other hand need freedom to think about systems in a context-aware manner. This allows them to use their intuition to solve problems.
- Novices and experts are fundamentally different. They see the world in different ways, and they react in different ways.
- _It's hard to articulate expertise_.

#### The Five Stages of the Dreyfus Model

- Dreyfus is applicable per skill. It’s a situational model and not a trait or talent model.
- The following are the five stages of the Dreyfus model:

1. Novice
    - Novices need recipes.

2. Advanced Beginner
    - Advanced beginners don't want the big picture.

3. Competent
    - Competents can troubleshoot.

4. Proficient
    - Proficient practioners can self-correct.
    - Proficient practitioners need the big picture. They will seek out andwant to understand the larger conceptual framework around this skill. They will be very frustrated by oversimplified information.

5. Expert
    - Experts work from intuition.
    - Although experts can be amazingly intuitive — to the point that it looks like magic to the rest of us — they may be completely inarticulate as to how they arrived at a conclusion. They genuinely don’t know; it just "felt right."

#### Using the Dreyfus Model Effectively

- In order to use the model effectively, we must first:

    1. Help transition `Advanced Beginners` to `Compotents` in order to raise the bar for people and to get them to start accepting responsibility of their actions. A major way to help achieve this is to have good exemplars in the environment since humans learn best by example.
    2. Keep expertise in practice. Rather, keep `Expert`s happy so they can influence the entire team they are a part of. This has a great impact on the entire team in the long-run.

#### Beware the Tool Trap

- Don’t succumb to the false authority of a tool or a model. There is no substitute for thinking.

### Chapter 3: This Is Your Brain

- A useful analogy for the human brain is a dual-CPU, single-master bus design computer system.

<img src="img/brain-design.png" alt="Schematic of a brain analogous to a computer system with 2 CPUs and a single-master bus." />

- The two CPUs of the brain are:

    1. CPU #1: von Neumann-style CPU for linear, logical thought and language processing. Processes instructions step-by-step, in order. CPU #1 is relatively slow. This linear-processing style of CPU #1 is called _linear_-mode or **L**-mode.

    2. CPU #2: A kind of super regular-expression search engine, responsible for searching and pattern-matching. It can go off "thinking" of something and return back results at a later time asynchronously. CPU #2 style processing is called _rich_-mode or **R**-mode.

- We need both the types of CPUs. **R**-mode is critical for intuition, problem solving, and creativity. **L**-mode gives us the power to work through the details and make it happen.

```plaintext
Extra Note:

CPU #1 is designed with an idle-loop routine as well. If it isn't processing anything,
it simply generates an internal stream of verbal chatter. This is the little voice
in our heads.

```

- Due to the unpredictable nature of R-mode, answers and insights can pop up at any time. As a result, it is always good to be prepared with some method to jot down ideas – all the ideas!

- If we don't keep track of great ideas, we will stop noticing that we have them. The corollory is also true: once we start keeping track of ideas, _we get more of them_.

- There’s no such thing as left brain and right brain; the various lobes of the brain and structures at different levels cooperate in a highly distributed fashion. But despite that cooperation, we still have these two different cognitive styles — CPU #1 and CPU #2.

- Our culture has clear L-mode bias. It is true that L-mode thinking has differentiated humankind from common beasts but it has also caused us to become too reliant of L-mode thinking. We've lost touch with R-mode thinking – the kind of thinking that adds a little bit of intuitive magic in the way we think.

- Neuroplasticity ie. the plastic nature of brains make our brains re-wireable. The maximum amount we can learn, or the number of skills we attain, is not fixed. Just thinking that your brain has more capacity for learning makes it so.

- On the flipside, the brain uses a "Use it or Lose it" policy wherein it dedicates more resources to whatever we do the most. This makes losing skills also a possibility. This is exactly why musicians practice scales incessantly, it's to do a refresh on their dynamic RAM.

### Chapter 4: Get in Your Right Mind

- The simplest thing one can do to involve more of the brain in problem solving and creativity is to activate more neural pathways than ususal ie. expanding sensory involvement.

- An example of involving more senses while problem solving is to fiddle with a paper clip or solve a tactile puzzle.

- Other than involving other senses, another technique is using cross-sensory feedback. Write the problem down, draw a picture, describe it verbally etc.

- Only using R-mode processing isn't the solution to our problem. By itself, R-mode cannot solve problems – it can even process language, after all. Instead the solution is to synchronise L-mode and R-mode processing.

- What we should strive for is an R-mode to L-mode flow. We want R-mode to lead to acquire context, initial knowledge and then we want L-mode to "productize" things and help us get shit done.

- Pair Programming is an excellent way to get the L-mode and R-mode to work together. Thinking in and using metaphors is another such way.

- Two ways to harvest more out of R-mode:

1. Image Streaming
2. Free-form journaling

- R-mode cannot be commanded, it can be invited. We almost have to defocus a bit to invite it. As soon as we become goal-oriented, L-mode sprints back up. Taking a walk in a labyrinth, engaging in mundane tasks like taking a shower are for this very reason a good way to invite R-mode.

- Non-goal-directed playing with an idea to make connections, see relationships, and gain insights is another way to invite R-mode.
