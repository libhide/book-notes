## Pragmatic Thinking and Learning

By Andy Hunt

### Recipes

1. Always consider the context
2. Use rules for novices, intuition for experts.
3. Know what you don't know.
4. Learn by watching and imitating.
5. Keep practicing in order to remain expert.
6. Avoid formal methods if you need creativity, intuition, or inventiveness.
7. Learn the skill of learning.

### Chapter 1: Introduction

- The essence of _pragmatism_ is to do what works — for you.
- Everything is interconnected: the physical world, social systems, your innermost thoughts, the unrelenting logic of the computer—everything forms one immense, interconnected system of reality. Nothing exists in isolation; everything is part of the system and part of a larger context.
- Small things having unexpectedly large effects is the hallmark of nonlinear systems.
- Systems thinking is a way to look at the world in which one tries to envision an object as a connection point of several systems, rather than as a discrete object unto itself. _Everything is interconnected_.

### Chapter 2: Journey from Novice to Expert

#### Introduction

- `Event theories` are a category of theories that can be measured; these types of theories can be verified and proven. You can judge the accuracy of an event theory.
- `Construct theories` are another category of theories that are intangible abstractions; you cannot prove them.  Instead, construct theories are evaluated in terms of their usefulness.
- Example of a construct theory: the concept of _Mind_. Mind is an abstraction; there’s really no such thing.  It’s just an idea, a concept.
- Dreyfus's model of skill acquisition is a construct theory.
- There’s more to skill levels than just being better, smarter, or faster. The Dreyfus model describes how and why our abilities, attitudes, capabilities, and perspectives change with skill level.

#### Novices vs Experts

- The novices need clear, context-free rules by which they can operate.
- The experts on the other hand need freedom to think about systems in a context-aware manner. This allows them to use their intuition to solve problems.
- Novices and experts are fundamentally different. They see the world in different ways, and they react in different ways.
- _It's hard to articulate expertise_.

#### The Five Stages of the Dreyfus Model

- Dreyfus is applicable per skill. It’s a situational model and not a trait or talent model.
- The following are the five stages of the Dreyfus model:

1. Novice
    - Novices need recipes.

2. Advanced Beginner
    - Advanced beginners don't want the big picture.

3. Competent
    - Competents can troubleshoot.

4. Proficient
    - Proficient practioners can self-correct.
    - Proficient practitioners need the big picture. They will seek out andwant to understand the larger conceptual framework around this skill. They will be very frustrated by oversimplified information.

5. Expert
    - Experts work from intuition.
    - Although experts can be amazingly intuitive — to the point that it looks like magic to the rest of us — they may be completely inarticulate as to how they arrived at a conclusion. They genuinely don’t know; it just "felt right."

#### Using the Dreyfus Model Effectively

- In order to use the model effectively, we must first:

    1. Help transition `Advanced Beginners` to `Compotents` in order to raise the bar for people and to get them to start accepting responsibility of their actions. A major way to help achieve this is to have good exemplars in the environment since humans learn best by example.
    2. Keep expertise in practice. Rather, keep `Expert`s happy so they can influence the entire team they are a part of. This has a great impact on the entire team in the long-run.

#### Beware the Tool Trap

- Don’t succumb to the false authority of a tool or a model. There is no substitute for thinking.
